# JSEXtractor
A wrapper around linkfinder.  
This script extracts all the paths from a file containing as many urls of js files and saves it in a text file pathsfromjs.txt.  
Once the paths are extracted it automates the process of creation of domain specific wordlist which can be used for directory bruteforcing.
